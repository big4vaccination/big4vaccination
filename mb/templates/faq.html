                            Children need vaccines to protect them from serious infectious diseases. An
                            estimated 2 to 3 million deaths are prevented every year because of vaccination.
                            Vaccinating all children in Australia is important to protect their health and the health
                            of the communities they live in. If people are vaccinated or immune to a disease,
                            then non-immune people are much less likely to meet an infected person and
                            catch the disease. Non-immune people
                            include people who can’t be vaccinated because of their age or because their immune systems
                            don’t work as well.

                            Your baby’s immune system is not fully developed like older children and adults. Therefore,
                            vaccination is an effective way to protect your baby against certain vaccine-preventable
                            infectious diseases. By keeping your child up-to-date with their vaccinations, you’re also
                            helping out the community by protecting the more vulnerable people from becoming infected.
                            Many of the diseases we are vaccinating against are rarely seen in Australia anymore, this
                            is because of routine widespread vaccination and surveillance. These diseases do still occur
                            in some parts of the world. If we stopped vaccination
                            and someone was to arrive from overseas with one of these infections, it could easily spread
                            to others.

                            Vaccines have been one of the most successful public health advances in history.
                            An estimated 2 to 3 million deaths are prevented every year because of vaccination.
                            Most routine childhood vaccines are effective in 85–95% of people. This means
                            that in every 100 people who receive a vaccine, between 5 and 15 of them may not
                            develop their own protective immunity.

                            Vaccines are given to many millions of people in Australia and billions worldwide.
                            Almost all side effects are minor. Being vaccinated is less harmful than getting the
                            disease—many of the diseases we vaccinate against can be fatal or have long-term
